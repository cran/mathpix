\title{Convert an image of an equation to a 'LaTeX' expression}
\usage{
mathpix(img, trial = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{image to be converted to LaTeX}

\item{trial}{should the trial API key be used (see Details)?}
}
\value{
(invisibly) the \code{rmarkdown} equation
}
\description{
Given an image file location, \code{mathpix} performs the relevant
transformations and send the data to the 'Mathpix' API, which returns a
'LaTeX' expression which should generate the typeset equation/expression in
that image. When using 'RStudio', the resulting 'LaTeX' expression is
automatically inserted into the current \code{rmarkdown} document.
}
\details{
I have obtained an API key for use with this app, which I have
included. If you have your own API key feel free to save that in your
environment (e.g. \code{~/.Renviron}) with the identifiers \code{MATHPIX_APP_ID} and
\code{MATHPIX_APP_KEY}. If this fails for some reason, the \code{trial} API key can
be used (as found on the mathpix API documentation site). Refer to
\url{https://docs.mathpix.com/} for full details.
